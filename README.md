The Smart HomeGuard Capstone Project aims to develop an innovative home security solution. The project integrates an Android app, machine learning models, cloud-based APIs, and various libraries to create a cutting-edge security system for residential properties.

*Key Components*
1. Android App: The Android app serves as the user interface, providing real-time property surveillance, notification alerts, and control.

2. Machine Learning Models: Machine learning models will help to classify individuals and objects, specifically focusing on intruder detection. 

3. Cloud-Based API: A cloud-based APIs from Azure, AWS or GCP will be used to host the machine learning models and expose endpoints for real-time data communication.

4. Integration of Technologies: The project leverages Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Room, Retrofit, and Work Manager for UI design, asynchronous tasks, data storage, API communication, and background task scheduling, respectively.

*Project Tasks*
1. **Android App Development**:
Design and implement a user-friendly UI using Jetpack Compose.
Integrate user authentication and data storage with Room and Coroutines.
Implement real-time object detection and alerts based on machine learning models.
Integrate API calls using Retrofit and Coroutines for cloud communication.
Enable background task scheduling with Work Manager for regular updates.
2. **Machine Learning Models**:
Gather and preprocess a relevant dataset for object and intruder classification.
Develop, train, and fine-tune machine learning models using TensorFlow/Keras.
Evaluate models for accuracy and reliability in real-world scenarios.
3. **Cloud-Based API**:
Set up cloud infrastructure on GCP/AWS for hosting models.
Deploy machine learning models to the cloud server.
Create and expose API endpoints for real-time communication.


5. **Integration and Testing**:



6. **Documentation and Deployment**:
